!!!Keep a library of all the ''Books'' you've read, or want to read. 

Your entire library can be kept in your Cardo. Assign a book to a particular Arena using the ''Arena:'' dropdown to keep books separated by work, personal reading, etc.

Keep track of your Books by status:

:''ToRead'' - A book you mean to read, whether you have it, or need to buy it
:''Reading'' - Currently reading, but not finished yet
:''Finished'' - A book you've read from start to finish
:''PutDown'' - Stopped part way through reading it, for any reason
:''GaveAway'' - Whether it was really good and you wanted to share, or really bad and you couldn't bear to keep it

{{$:/plugins/Cardo/images/calendar-x}}Keep track of when you started reading this book. When the date is set and shown, click on the ''[x]'' to clear it. 
{{$:/plugins/Cardo/images/checkbox}}Click the checkbox if you've read it (or at least attempted to) more than once.

{{$:/plugins/Cardo/images/star-filled}}{{$:/plugins/Cardo/images/star-filled}}{{$:/plugins/Cardo/images/star-outline}}{{$:/plugins/Cardo/images/star-outline}}Rate this book by clicking the stars beside the title.

Select the proper genre of the book from the row of checkboxes. You can add a genre by creating a new Tiddler and tagging it with <<tag genre>>.

Use the ''Author:'' dropdown to indicate who wrote the book. Other books by this author will appear on the author's dashboard, by clicking the ''â‡ª'' arrow.

Use the ''Loaned Out'' checkbox and dropdown to keep track of who's borrowing the book at the moment.

Any notes you want to keep as you read can be added to a book by clicking the ''(+)'' button in the "Book Notes (By Chapter)'' list. If it's an important note, click the {{$:/plugins/Cardo/images/star-outline}} on the note's row.
