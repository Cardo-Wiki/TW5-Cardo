This is a really important project to plan all the projects I'm planning. It involves making a whole bunch of tasks, getting a group of people together, and organizing them all.

Generally, I want to:

*Get all my stuff together
*Figure out a way to get it all done
**(Using David Allen's //Getting Things Done// methodology would be good)
*Managing it with ''Cardo''
