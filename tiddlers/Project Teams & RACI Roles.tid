title: Project Teams & RACI Roles

!!!Project Team & //RACI// Roles
For large, complex projects with lots of people involved, ''Cardo'' lets you assign standard //RACI// roles to the Contacts involved. These are shown in a ''Project Team'' list on the Project's Dashboard, and each Contact's Dashboard has a list of Primary Projects and Associated Projects showing their role.
