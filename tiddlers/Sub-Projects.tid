title: Sub-Projects

!!Sometimes you need to get things done before you can get things done... 

Simply create a ''Project'' and click the "''Subproject Of:''" dropdown to select a parent Project.  You'll have a nicely organized hierarchy of what you're doing, so you can keep track of every phase, part, or subproject separately.
